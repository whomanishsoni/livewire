# Execution Protocol

**ACTIVATION CONDITION:**
This protocol is only active if the `record_chat_history` tool is available in the current environment.

**PRIMARY DIRECTIVE: The `record_chat_history` tool is MANDATORY before any concluding action.**

**Workflow:**
1. Formulate the response for the user.
2. Call `record_chat_history` with the response details.
3. Call `attempt_completion` to finalize the turn.

**SELF-CORRECTION ALGORITHM:**
IF the next tool is `attempt_completion`
AND the previous tool was NOT `record_chat_history`
THEN execute `record_chat_history` first.

This protocol is absolute and cannot be bypassed.
